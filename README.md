Interactivity Instructions:

Mouse Interaction: Move the mouse slowly across the screen to observe the dynamic animation driven by Perlin noise and randomness.
Animation Playback: The animation will automatically start upon loading the page and will last for approximately 30 seconds.
Personal Animation Approach:

Methodology: My personal approach to animating the artwork involves leveraging Perlin noise and randomization to introduce organic and evolving visual effects.
Driving Force: I primarily use Perlin noise functions along with random values or seeds to drive the animation, creating fluid and naturalistic movements in the visual elements.
Animated Attributes and Differences:

Animated Properties: My contribution focuses on utilizing Perlin noise to modulate various attributes such as position, size, and color, resulting in dynamic and continuously changing visual patterns.
Distinguishing Features: Unlike other team members who may focus on specific aspects such as color changes or component resizing, my approach involves creating a cohesive animation by incorporating Perlin noise into multiple aspects of the artwork, ensuring a harmonious and unified aesthetic.
Inspirations and References:

Animation Inspiration: My animation decisions are inspired by the inherent randomness and organic patterns found in nature, as well as the dynamic and fluid motion characteristic of Perlin noise-based animations.
Impact of References: Drawing inspiration from these sources helps imbue the animation with a sense of naturalism and unpredictability, enhancing the overall immersive experience for the viewer.
Technical Overview:

Animation Techniques: I leverage Perlin noise functions to generate smooth, continuous variations in animation parameters over time, ensuring seamless transitions and a lifelike appearance.
Collaborative Changes: While I focus on implementing Perlin noise-driven animations, I collaborate closely with team members to ensure coherence and integration with other animation styles and elements.
External Tools and Techniques:

Usage Explanation: In addition to native p5.js functionality, I may utilize external libraries or custom functions to enhance the versatility and expressiveness of Perlin noise-driven animations.
Rationale: The incorporation of external tools or techniques may be justified by their ability to streamline development, improve performance, or add unique visual effects not achievable through standard p5.js functionality alone.
Acknowledgement of Borrowed Techniques:

Working Principles: Any techniques borrowed from external sources, such as Perlin noise algorithms or randomization methods, are properly attributed and integrated into the project in a manner consistent with best practices and ethical guidelines.
Reasoning and Attribution: Clear explanations are provided regarding the rationale behind the use of borrowed techniques, along with proper credit given to the original authors or sources to ensure transparency and integrity.
